ðŸ‘‹ I am Linh Le. I am currently an assistant professor in Analytics and Data Science.

This profile includes some of my research that I am allowed to publish. 

I will also post learning materials for my classes here, and keep demonstration codes for my blog on practical data analytics at https://youranalystbuddy.com/.
